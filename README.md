# personal-website-rep
A repository to house the personal website of Sydney Pipkin, including multiple html files, a css file, a javascript file, and a repository for images. Please download all files to ensure functionality when viewing the site with VSCode.
Comments will be fleshed-out further as the project progresses, and the code will (hopefully) become more-and-more complex as I learn more about JavaScript.
The next major project after the current phase has seen completion will be a form (written into the header) where users will be able to contact me.
As I continue to improve with CSS, I hope to make many improvements on UI and aesthetic design.
-Thank you for reading, enjoy. :)
